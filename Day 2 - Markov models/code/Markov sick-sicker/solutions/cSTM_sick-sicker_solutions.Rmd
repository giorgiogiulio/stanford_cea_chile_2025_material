To program this tutorial we used:
R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)
Platform: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Running under: Mac OS 12.2.1
RStudio: Version 1.4.1717 2009-2021 RStudio, Inc

Implements a time-independent Sick-Sicker cSTM model that evaluates four strategies:

-   Standard of Care (SoC): best available care for the patients with the disease. This scenario reflects the natural history of the disease    
  progression.
- Strategy A: treatment A is given to patients in the Sick and Sicker states, but does only improves the quality of life  of those in the Sick state.
- Strategy B: treatment B is given to all sick patients and reduces disease progression from the Sick to Sicker state.
- Strategy AB: This strategy combines treatment A and treatment B. The disease progression is reduced and individuals in the Sick state have an 
  improved quality of life.

### Discounting factors
